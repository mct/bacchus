LOG047.txt

	Data recorded during the flight on the payload's MicroSD card.

aprsmon-mct.txt

	APRS packets observed by mct's laptop, riding in the chase
	vehicle driven by Andy.  Recorded by running the command
	"aprsmon | tee | tai64n | tai64nlocal".  (However the time on
	mct's laptop may have been off by up to 3 seconds; his machine
	was not running NTP.)

xastir-mct.txt

	APRS packets logged on mct's laptop by Xastir.  (This data should
	match the data in aprsmon-mct.txt, however he was running aprsmon
	for longer than he was running xastir, so this is only a subset
	of the pre-launch packets received.)

xastir-mid.txt

	APRS packets logged on midendian's laptop by Xastir, riding in
	the chase vehicle driving by Shannon.

xastir-mid.kml

	A GoogleEarth KML file of the Bacchus IV track, generated by Xastir
	running on midendian's laptop by clicking "save track".  (Better KML
	files can be produced by using data in the LOG047.txt logfile.)

aprs.fi.txt

	A copy of all of the raw packets from KJ6AOD-11 that were digipeated to
	<http://aprs.fi> via IGates.  Beware of duplicate packets, and packets
	that were digipeated out of order.
