This directory contains APRS usage plots for the Bacchus V flight, created by
Lynn W. Deffenbaugh (KJ4ERJ) (ldeffenb@homeside.to).  The files were mirrored
from <http://ldeffenb.dnsalias.net.nyud.net/Tracking/Balloons/KJ6AOD-11*>.

He adds:

    "Note that these plots were generated from APRS-IS data.  This means that
    only the first station to gate to the Internet is included.  A single packet
    at extreme range probably means that many more packets were heard that far
    out, it's just that the ones that show were heard first at that range.

    "Also, if you look at the D plots (extreme zoom showing primarily the
    originating position), any point with more than 1 red line leading from it
    was gated multiple times probably with a significant delay between the first
    and second (and sometimes third) gating."
