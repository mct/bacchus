On Tuesday evening, June 1, 2010, Andy, Shannon and I powered on the recently
recovered Bacchus II payload at Noisebridge, using a bench power supply.  At
first I left the GPS unpowered (in Bacchus II, it uses a different power source
from the rest of the flight computer and radio), but once I confirmed the other
components were working, I fed it 5v from the 5v bus.  This directory contains
the data captured via the flight computer's console, and the packets soundmodem
on my laptop decoded from my HT (sitting just a few feet away).
