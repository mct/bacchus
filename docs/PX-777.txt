To configure the PX-777 for flight:

    - In the menu system, set the squelch to "1"

    - In the menu system, set "Light" to "Off" (so that the LCD backlight
      is never on, not even when a key is pressed).

    - Tune the radio to 144.390.

    - Lock the keypad by holding down the "Lock" key.

    - Power the radio off, and back on again.  Confirm the keypad is still
      locked, the frequency is 144.390, and the backlight is off.  Turn the
      volume all the way down, and you're set to go.
